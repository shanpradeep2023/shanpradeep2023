Hey there 👋, I'm Shan Pradeep R!



Glad to see you here!   
I am a 3rd year B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering student at NMAM Institute of Engineering.

I have a passion for problem-solving and pioneering first-principle thinking, driven by purpose and fueled by 
the challenge of finding solutions, with a strong foundation in Java, Spring,Spring Boot, Srvlets, JSPs,  etc. 
I've been learning Backend, with the commitment to making a positive impact through technology.

I'm an explorer of new tech, an avid learner, and a problem-solver at heart. When I'm not in code, you'll find
me watching tech-related YouTube videos, fueling my curiosity.

Feel free to connect with me @shanpradeep2023 for all things tech or just to say hello! Let's shape the future
of tech together. 🌟
